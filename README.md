Personal Portfolio Website
This Personal Portfolio Website is a responsive and interactive platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. The site features a clean layout with sections for an introduction, an about me overview, a project showcase, and a contact form. Users can easily navigate through smooth scrolling and engaging animations, while a mobile-friendly design ensures optimal viewing on all devices. This project demonstrates my web development skills and serves as a professional online presence.
